  <li>
    What devotion is for me: Isis scouring and gathering the 14 pieces of Osiris' cut up body that are scattered over the Earth, then performing a great act of magic—with the help of Nepthys, Thoth, and Anubis—to bring her husband back to life.
    <br><br>
    I think this is why my love language is words of affirmation. What we speak of, how often we say them, how we say them—all are elements of spellcasting. The great act of magic is speaking life into your beloved.</li>
  <br>
  <li>I want to carefully remove my heart from my body. Wash it clean. Make it brand new. It housed many strangers who weren't nice house guests.</li>
  <br>
  <li>My favorite Tagalog word is "lambing". I think our culture can be described by that word. At our core, we're craftspeople and we inject "lambing" to whatever our hands touch: things we make, land we till, community we foster. I'm not sure when we started losing our "lambing".
    <br><br>
  What it means: "While Google Translate says that lambing is tenderness, it fails to adequately define what lambing is. It’s like this: tenderness + sweetness + being affectionate + wanting to be caressed = lambing."</li>
  <br>
  <li>I have a hunch that the quality of my experience of other people depends on the quality of my perception. My admiration of someone's essence might actually be a radar for an aspect of my self that I'm oblivious of or a compass guiding me to a new self that I'm desiring to meet.</li>
  <br>
  <li>I descended from a long line of sea and farm folks and the thought that the soul, after its release from the flesh, leaves a bit of itself in places where it has experienced love fills me with solace. That they never really left but only transformed: the land they tilled, now the shoulders I stand on; the ocean they scoured, new limbs to embrace me with.</li>
